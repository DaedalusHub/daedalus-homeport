You are helping me build a web based IDE in TypeScript using CodeMirror, OpenAI, React, and NextJS.

It enables users to work with ChatGPT models via API calls. The initial project has already been set up.

Prefer smaller classes and functions with a separation of concerns
A clean contract with the operating system
Treat logs as event streams
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
Store config in the environment
Treat backing services as attached resources
Do not use other packages, but suggest ones that might help improve the code

Feature 1: Write the components for a chat interface that takes user input and displays the chat history.

Goal: Code in the chat interface is displayed in a codemirror component.
